## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning platform for mastering **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. It includes commonly used data structures and a variety of algorithms, along with explanations of how they work and their performance considerations.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. It allows fast access to elements using an index.

- **Use cases**: Storing fixed-size data, efficient lookups and traversals.
  
### Linked Lists

A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, where each node points to the next node in the sequence.

- **Use cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions and deletions.
  
### Stacks

A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end (the top).

- **Use cases**: Undo operations in software, parsing expressions.

### Queues

A queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

- **Use cases**: Task scheduling, handling requests in a queue.

### Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with each node having a value and potentially a set of child nodes.

- **Use cases**: Hierarchical data representation, file systems.

### Graphs

A graph consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.

- **Use cases**: Social networks, web crawlers, routing algorithms.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specified order (ascending or descending).

- **Example**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
  
### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find the position of an element in a collection.

- **Example**: Binary Search, Linear Search.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is a method for solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to avoid redundant work.

- **Example**: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, removing solutions that fail to meet the problemâ€™s constraints.

- **Example**: Permutations, N-Queens problem.

## Usage
To use the algorithms and data structures in this repository, simply import the relevant function(s) into your project. Here is how you can use the bubble sort algorithm:
